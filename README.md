# Implementation of Chaum-Pedersen Protocol

The present repository contains an implementation of the Chaum-Pedersen Protocol. The implementation consists in a seerver and a client using gRPC protocol for communication. 

## Implementation

The implementation in Rust is in a single project with two binaries, one for the server called `zkp-server` and another one for the client called `zkp-client`. This was done for simplicity but in the real world it might be better to separate the client and server in their own projects.

## Limitations

### Registration



### Choice of `g`,`h`,`q`
